Project Overview

Extract data from reaching box

            Max pulls
            Number of successes
            Number of pulls
            Identify errors
                        Number of pulls jumping rapidly

 

Use EMG data

            Number pulls
            Identify errors
                        Number of pulls jumping rapidly

Plot

            Each animal
                        Force (max) at each time point
                        Average number of pulls per success

           
Each group

                        Force (max) at each time point
                        Average number of pulls per success

 
Plots should include

                                    Error bars
                                    Significance

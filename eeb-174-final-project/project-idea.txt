Final Project Proposal


Traumatic brain injury and stroke can lead to paralysis. I hypothesize that by electrically stimulating the spinal cord, the severity of stroke symptoms can be alleviated by strengthening surviving motor connections. To test this, I will analyze and measure EMG muscle data obtained from rats reaching for a lever pre- and post- surgery. This data will provide insights into further understanding stroke rehabilitation and recovery from paralysis.

 

Project Overview:

 

Extract data from reaching box

            Max pulls

            Number of successes

            Number of pulls

 

            Identify errors

                        Number of pulls jumping rapidly

 

Use EMG data

            Number pulls

 

            Identify errors

                        Number of pulls jumping rapidly

 

Plot

            Each animal

                        Force (max) at each time point

                        Average number of pulls per success

           

Each group

                        Force (max) at each time point

                        Average number of pulls per success

 

Plots should include

                                    Error bars

                                    Significance

 

Data for this project has been collected and recorded as part of directed research under Lisa Moore and Dr. Daniel C. Lu at the Neuroplasticity and Repair Laboratory in the Department of UCLA Neurosurgery. I will be using python, R, and shell to manipulate text data and perform necessary operations. Statistical analysis and visualization of data will be done in R. A final report will be drafted in markdown or latex with commented code and embedded figures. The project will include a history of version control and a short presentation will be given.
